<p>Boogarins show night in Porto Alegre. The tour centers on <em>"Bacuri"</em>, their latest album, which I actually stopped listening to after buying my ticket &mdash; a trick I picked up from my dad Mr. Luiz: &ldquo;<em>The thing is not to overplay the songs you love, so you don&rsquo;t get tired of them.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>It felt like one of those rare nights of <em>Brasil with an S</em> &mdash; the kind that celebrates its own culture. That vibe hit even harder considering we were in a city where local authorities had shut down our organic celebrations on Carnival, only to funnel public funds into a Saint Patrick&rsquo;s Day cringe-fest a week later. Make of that what you will.</p>
<p>Everything was unfolding smoothly&hellip; until I had a strange little moment that stuck with me all night.</p>
<p>My Uber dropped me off on Joaquim Nabuco Street, right by the venue, Opini&atilde;o. As I stepped out, the driver leaned over and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cool, what&rsquo;s going on tonight? Big crowd?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I froze for a second. What does a <em>big crowd</em> look like? In my fantasy, Boogarins would be selling out Beira-Rio Stadium &mdash; full production, lasers imported from Slovakia, 30-foot-high screens, the full sensory overload experience.</p>
<p>Instead, I just shrugged and kind of yelled back. &ldquo;Not sure it&rsquo;ll be that packed&hellip; It&rsquo;s more like an alternative kind of band, you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I realized I&rsquo;d stepped out right by the artists&rsquo; entrance &mdash; basically in front of their van. Was I being a fan or what?</p>
<p>Later on, a friend goes, &ldquo;Chill, man. Even if they heard you, they probably just laughed it off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The venue was decently full, but that comment stuck with me. As I waited in the crowd for the <em>boogarinic beings</em> to take the stage, these were the kinds of thoughts running through my head:</p>
<p>~&ldquo;Look at all this movement pushing back against the 6-day workweek and all the other nonsense. Look how one&rsquo;s whole life gets swallowed by work. If it were up to the suits, even our leisure time would have to turn a profit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>~&ldquo;And it starts with those who <em>consume</em> music &mdash; but let&rsquo;s be real for a second: who nowadays really sits down and feels an album?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alright, maybe that&rsquo;s just me sounding like an old man, right? Fair enough. So, nothing like psychedelia to stretch out time and make space for ideas.</p>
<p>The moment the band came on stage and people gathered in the dark, it all hit me at once. Rick Beato popped into my head &mdash; that cool guy on YouTube who&rsquo;s always posting insightful interviews while also debating about how music as we know is dead.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>One time Rick went through a list of the 25 most streamed artists on Spotify just to prove how few actual bands can survive the meat grinder.</p>
<p>At the time of the video, there were only <strong>three</strong> bands formed in the past ten years. One was called Grupo Frontera and another was Richy Mitch &amp; The Coal Miners, whose work I look up to and found really ok. The other one was that processed cheese cosplay known as M&aring;neskin (sorry, my opinion &mdash; I just can&rsquo;t help it).</p>
<p>Anyway, his point was: if the 2000s were the boy band era, by 2010 it wasn&rsquo;t even worth being a band anymore.</p>
<p>Which, curiously, is when Boogarins was born.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Being a recent fan, I could use a bit of context too.</p>
<p><em>Bacuri</em> is about celebrating fatherhood for some of the band members &mdash; and also the band&rsquo;s own maturity and longevity, from the way the album was recorded and produced.</p>
<p>It seems that Boogarins has been playing with themes of cycles, beginnings and endings since their earliest work. At least that&rsquo;s what first drew me in when I first listened to them right after the pandemic.</p>
<p>Their debut album, <em>As Plantas que Curam</em> (2013), quick drew attention after being posted on Bandcamp and picked up by a North American blog to which they sent their material.</p>
<p>Not long after that, they received a three-album offer they couldn&rsquo;t refuse from the Other Music label.</p>
<p>Their second album, the flawless <em>Manual</em> (2015), earned a Grammy nomination, and after that they just titled their next release <em>L&aacute; Vem a Morte</em> &mdash; &ldquo;Here Comes Death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably figured out where I&rsquo;m going with this: here was a young band embracing every bright new possibility &mdash; yet always flirting, in their lyrics, with the idea of impermanence in the face of the music industry's so-called greatness.</p>
<p>Then came <em>Sombroud&uacute;vida</em> (a play on the Portuguese words for &ldquo;shadow&rdquo; and &ldquo;doubt&rdquo;) &mdash; an album full of great tracks that still hold up in their live set today &mdash; followed by live experimental sessions, and finally a double album called <em>Manchaca</em>, built from the results of those improvisations.</p>
<p>Their songwriting had clearly matured, gradually embracing experimentation. What hadn&rsquo;t crossed my mind was just how much their live performances were evolving.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Back to the present, cut to Opini&atilde;o show. What felt like three hours of reflection might&rsquo;ve only lasted a couple minutes.</p>
<p>Suddenly, that train of thought &mdash; from Rick Beato&rsquo;s ideas to my impressions of the band &mdash; got cut off. Something shifted in my thoughts and time already felt warped as they took the stage, in this order: Dinho, Ynai&atilde;, Raphael, and Benke.</p>
<p>I was reminded of the last Boogarins show I&rsquo;d seen &mdash; when they performed a good chunk of <em>Manchaca </em>and <em>Sombroud&uacute;vida </em>albums [you can feel <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5DlgszOXGATvzNjdTpS415?si=67d8fca3260c447d" target="_blank">here</a> that setlist]. At that show, the stage setup was different: Dinho stood stage right and handled most of the vocals.</p>
<p>I also thought back to a gig at Agulha, just days before the great flood &mdash; the brutal May 2024 storm that swallowed up parts of Porto Alegre and destroyed that venue entirely.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m slightly nearsighted too, to be fair &mdash; and not sure also if that was part of their idea. But now, with no fixed mic placements and no real &ldquo;center,&rdquo; it felt like the band had multiplied.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>No clue about that. The intro to the first song had already started playing and it just hit me.</p>
<p>I felt lucky to be up close to something so special, and deep down, trying not to sound insensitive, also grateful I&rsquo;m not 1.5 meters tall. Short and nearsighted would be too much.</p>
<p>Regardless of that, I saw a guy nearly this height enjoying and seemingly fully connected with everything. For some random association, 'Deleuze' pops into my mind (I'm that weird).</p>
<p>A line of yellow spotlights cuts across my eyes, and I start drifting about how Boogarins know they belong to a movement of a &ldquo;minor music&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the milliseconds between two drum hits, I suddenly drift into those wild ideas between philosophers Deleuze and Guattari, when they said Kafka wrote &ldquo;minor literature&rdquo; because he used a marginal language &mdash; and that&rsquo;s what made him great: in his game, comparisons no longer applied.</p>
<p>The <em>bandinha</em>, their own term of endearment on social media (literally &ldquo;little band&rdquo; in Portuguese), was there, but in no way as a small band. Not as a lesser band, but as a minor one, in the deleuzian sense:</p>
<p>Dismantling hierarchies while making beauty out of fragmentation; embracing the importance of creating on the margins of dominant industry languages by singing experiments and displacements in Third World Portuguese &ndash; all while daring to be a living, breathing organism on stage.</p>
<p>By doing that, they shape a kind of music that feels slightly off-center and yet deeply collaborative, staying true to their own terms.</p>
<p>What struck me the most during that reflection was how many incredible bands I&rsquo;m probably missing out on.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>I think that says enough.  I'll be back to watching the band in front of me in a sec... Maybe that&rsquo;s why some (mostly local) lazy music journalists can&rsquo;t describe what Boogarins actually is. They always seem to fall back on comparing them to Tame Impala.</p>
<p>Tame Impala is great, those songs are brilliant and Kevin Parker is a genius, so being compared to his work could easily sound like an obvious compliment. But the thing is Tame Impala is a controlled vision &mdash; a studio mindtrip executed live with random precision. I'm not even getting into the difference in personal backgrounds.</p>
<p>I have nothing against the seriousness of rock; Slint's <em>Spiderland</em> is among the best things I've ever heard, and the near-coldness of live psychedelic classics like Pink Floyd fascinates me. However, there&rsquo;s a kind of psychedelia that only emerges in the vivacity and open dialogue between musicians on stage.</p>
<p>Boogarins, like many great bands that create together, bring something to the stage that solo projects can&rsquo;t &mdash; the energy of collective creation.</p>
<p>That gap becomes clear as the moment resolves; everything clicks just as Ynai&atilde; sings the <em>Bacur&iacute;</em> lyrics about &ldquo;<em>reigning in the dust of the sun</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Thinking about it right there, no analogy seemed more fitting than this one.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>
<p><em>Bacur&iacute;</em> is truly a coronation &mdash; the reign of a &ldquo;minor&rdquo; band doing what they&rsquo;ve learned, beyond the realm of comparisons.</p>
<p>In <em>Chuva dos Olhos</em>, they sing about the marginal freedom of a subject who &ldquo;<em>didn&rsquo;t want more / didn&rsquo;t want ground, just wanted peace</em>&rdquo;;</p>
<p>In <em>Chrystian &amp; Ralf (S&oacute; Deus Sabe)</em>, Benke steps up to the mic to speak of all the labor involved &mdash; &ldquo;<em>To gust, to love / To sing without fear / My own artifice / Better than suffocating / And while trying to speak / Of the unreal / I end up feeling sick</em>&rdquo;;</p>
<p>In <em>Corpo-Asa</em>, they also share the other side of it &mdash; &ldquo;<em>the blooming, paying to see, sharing dreams</em>&rdquo;;</p>
<p>"<em>Don't mind if it's late / It doesn't matter anymore / Just let it stray</em>&rdquo; I think it was while <em>Amor de Indie</em> was fading out that Raphael turns his gaze to some gap above the stage and whistling a different melody, distracting us from the fact the music was ending.</p>
<p>In <em>Deixa </em>(my favorite moment of the set), Benke dives headfirst into Gilmour-like progressions and tones, until the melody sweeps everything away to say that &ldquo;<em>the force of being bends all directions</em>&rdquo;;</p>
<p>By the time Raphael leads the badass <em>Poeira</em>, these guys were just reading my thoughts. &ldquo;<em>Kept quiet / Then changed my mind</em>&rdquo; summed up the whole trip, at least for me.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Boogarins point toward invention, expansion, and breath &mdash; &nbsp;in a world where packs of suit-wearing denialists stage drama via through artificial intelligence; on a planet where swarms of producers pirate singles left and right to power the stage acts of millionaire inflatable puppets.</p>
<p>By doing so, hopefully they make these forms of art more accessible to those who, nowadays, can't seem to stop and truly feel an entire album.</p>
<p>At heart, the so-called &lsquo;little band&rsquo; knows exactly who they&rsquo;re up to being: leaning into the everyday need for psychedelia, and more alive than ever &mdash; not despite, but because of the music they create.</p>
<p>A task reserved for true giants.</p>
